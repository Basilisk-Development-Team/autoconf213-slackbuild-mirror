# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

autoconf213: autoconf213 (generate configuration scripts)
autoconf213:
autoconf213: GNU autoconf 2.13 is an extensible package of m4 macros that
autoconf213: produce shell scripts to automatically configure software source
autoconf213: code packages.
autoconf213: These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
autoconf213: systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf 2.13 creates a
autoconf213: configuration script for a package from a template file that lists
autoconf213: the operating system features that the package can use, in the
autoconf213: form of m4 macro calls. You must install the "m4" package to be
autoconf213: able to use autoconf 2.13.
